Currently thinking:
    Spawn 2 bots, 1 British, 1 German/Jap, tell them to kill, give them ex
        100hp
        64 * 300 ticks (19200) to fight
    Run like 500 times
    For each record facingRight,myX,myY,enemyX,enemyY,distanceToGround,enemyDistanceToGround,enemyThrottle,myThrottle,enemySpeed,mySpeed,enemyAngle,myAngle,OptionNumber
    and only keep records for winners
    where OptionNumber represents a choice of what to do ex
        1 - Angle Up
        2 - Angle Up & Change Direction
        3 - Change Direction
        4 - Angle Down
        etc.
    and train model with it and maybe then repeatedly do this and mix with genetic selection and stuff idk tired

    Can also create training data from real human data
        Either 2 players
        OR 
        Ex 30s of flying around for fun -> Recorded -> After 30s a bot spawns at your location and runs through the test data and your chasing and killing the bot is recordeded also your running away recorded if you survive or do it twice you know so you get good killing data / running away data
