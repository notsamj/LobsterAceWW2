On the server end:
Receives information from the client asynchronously
At the start of a tick the server collects all the user input received since the last tick THEN
goes back in time and reticks (different tick function) to account for user input and then sends out a version of the updated state at the end of the tick.

On the client end:
Asynchronously stores 1 latest state of the server
At the start of a tick -> takes the latest state received and builds from it to the current tick then runs as normal
Requires 2 tick functions so not sending information while catching up
Sends out information at the end of every tick
