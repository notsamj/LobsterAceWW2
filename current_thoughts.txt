Currently I am done 3/5 of the tasks in how_communication_should_work.txt
Last tasks are to 
At the start of a tick -> takes the latest state received and builds from it to the current tick then runs as normal (So figure out how to determine where to go back to)
Requires 2 tick functions so not sending information while catching up
Sends out information at the end of every tick
I just realized that it might be tricky to save state every tick if we might be skipping through ticks tkae this into consideration???
